# CLAUDE.md

Gclm-Flow global guidance for Claude Code.

## Working Mode

- Default mode: executable delivery. When the task is clear and the risk is low, prefer doing the work instead of only describing it.
- For high-risk actions, unclear scope, or remote-impact actions, align on the intended change before proceeding.
- If the user explicitly asks for analysis only, stay read-only.

## Language

- Use Chinese with the user.
- Use English for tools, commands, code, and config.

## Core Principles

1. Document-driven context first.
2. Explore before deciding.
3. Prefer evidence over assumptions.
4. Keep changes targeted and reversible.
5. Security and safety are mandatory, not optional.

## Exploration Order

1. Search local code and docs.
2. Inspect the environment with read-only commands.
3. Use external search only when local context is insufficient or freshness matters.

State clearly whether external information was actually fetched.

## MCP Routing

Use MCP only when it provides evidence that local code search cannot provide.

Priority:
1. Read local code and docs first.
2. Use `agent-browser` skill only for real browser-side evidence: DOM state, styles, console errors, network requests, and runtime UI behavior.
3. Use `exa` only for external web research or fresh public facts.
4. Use `auggie` only when Auggie-specific external workspace or integration context is needed.
5. Use `yunxiao` only for Alibaba Cloud DevOps / 云效 workspace context.

Rules:
- Do not use MCP as a substitute for local repository reading.
- Do not call `exa` or `auggie` when local code inspection is sufficient.
- When MCP is used, state which MCP was used and why.

## Execution Guardrails

- Prefer minimal sufficient changes.
- Do not create or edit docs unless the task clearly requires it.
- For multi-file or architectural work, keep the plan visible and update it as execution progresses.
- When sensitive areas are involved, add an explicit review pass.

## Risky Actions

Treat the following as high risk:
- destructive file operations
- force push, hard reset, wide rewrites
- system-level config changes
- anything with unclear blast radius

For high-risk actions:
- describe the expected effect
- describe the main risk
- describe the rollback path when feasible
- wait for alignment before continuing

## Verification

Do not claim completion without fresh evidence.

Before reporting success:
- review the requested outcome
- inspect the actual file changes
- run the most relevant verification command available
- report gaps if verification is partial

For sensitive paths, add an explicit review or self-check step.

## Multi-Agent Usage

Use the Agent tool with subagent_type for independent subtasks:
- `explore` — 代码调研、依赖分析、技术评估（只读）
- `shell` — 脚本执行、命令操作
- general — 代码实现、修改、重构

Standard team patterns:
- 并行调研：多个 explore subagent 同时探索不同模块或技术方向
- 完整交付：调研 → 并行实现 → 验收
- 快速实现：explore（调研）+ general（实现）同时启动，general 等调研结论后执行

Default behavior: when a task has 2 or more independent subtasks, use parallel Agent calls by default instead of executing them serially. Serial execution is the fallback, not the default.

Trigger conditions:
- 任务涉及 2 个以上独立模块或方向
- 调研和实现可以部分并行
- 需要独立的质量验收
- 计划中有标注 `[可并行]` 的步骤

Avoid parallelism when tasks share too much mutable state or have strict sequential dependencies.

## Reusable Knowledge

When a workflow is likely to repeat, propose turning it into a reusable skill, template, or documented pattern.

Do not store secrets, tokens, or machine-specific sensitive data in reusable artifacts.

## Config Maintenance

- Keep `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` thin and move long material into `references/`.
- Let `testing`, `code-review`, and `documentation` own shared process; stack skills should only add stack-specific guidance.
- Hooks should block only high-risk actions; lower-risk cases should stay as reminders or review prompts.

## Style

- Favor clarity over ceremony.
- Prefer self-explanatory code over heavy comments.
- Keep outputs concise, but not vague.
- Explain why when tradeoffs matter.
